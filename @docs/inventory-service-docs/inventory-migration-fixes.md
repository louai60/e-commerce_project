# Inventory Migration Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes made to the product service to address issues related to the migration of inventory functionality to the dedicated inventory service.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Column Errors**: Fixed errors related to missing `inventory_qty` and `inventory_status` columns in the database.

2. **SQL Query Updates**: Updated SQL queries in the repository code to remove references to the removed columns.

3. **JSON Structure**: Updated the JSON structure for product creation to use the `inventory` object with `initial_quantity` instead of the `inventory_qty` field.

## Changes Made

### 1. SQL Query Updates

Updated the following SQL queries to remove references to `inventory_qty` and `inventory_status` columns:

- `getProductVariantsAndAttributes` in `product_repository.go` and `product_repository_updated.go`
- `GetProductVariants` in `product_repository.go`, `product_repository_updated.go`, `repositories.go`, `postgres_repository.go`, and `adapter.go`
- `UpdateVariant` in `repositories.go` and `postgres_repository.go`
- `CreateVariant` in `repositories.go`

### 2. Documentation

Created documentation to guide users on how to create products with inventory in the new architecture:

- `@docs/inventory-service-usage-guide.md`: Explains how to use the inventory service
- `@docs/product-creation-guide.md`: Provides guidance on creating products with the new JSON structure

## Testing

The changes were tested by:

1. Creating a product with the new JSON structure
2. Listing products to verify they can be retrieved
3. Getting a specific product to verify it can be retrieved

## Conclusion

The product service now correctly handles the separation of inventory functionality into the dedicated inventory service. Products can be created, listed, and retrieved without errors related to missing inventory columns.

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any other issues related to the inventory migration
2. Consider updating the API documentation to reflect the new JSON structure
3. Consider adding validation to ensure users don't try to use the old `inventory_qty` field
