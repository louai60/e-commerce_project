# End-to-End Inventory Workflow

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete end-to-end workflow for inventory management in our e-commerce system, from product creation to customer delivery and returns. It details the responsibilities of each service, how they interact, and the current implementation status.

## System Architecture Overview

Our inventory management system is built on a microservices architecture with the following key components:

1. **Product Service**: Manages product information (title, description, price, etc.)
2. **Inventory Service**: Manages inventory levels, warehouses, and transactions
3. **Order Service** (planned): Will handle order processing and fulfillment
4. **Purchasing Service** (planned): Will manage supplier orders and stock replenishment
5. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services and handles authentication
6. **Admin Dashboard**: Provides UI for inventory management
