# Inventory Service Integration

This document describes the integration of the inventory service with other components of the e-commerce system.

## Overview

The inventory service has been integrated with the following components:

1. **Product Service** - For inventory management during product operations
2. **API Gateway** - For exposing inventory endpoints to clients

Future integrations will include:

3. **Order Service** - For inventory reservation during checkout
4. **Admin Dashboard** - For inventory management UI

## Product Service Integration

### Components Added

1. **Inventory Client** (`backend/product-service/clients/inventory_client.go`)
   - Handles communication with the inventory service
   - Provides methods for creating, retrieving, and updating inventory items
   - Includes error handling and retry logic

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Added inventory service configuration in `config.go`
   - Updated development configuration with inventory service address

3. **Service Layer Updates**
   - Modified `ProductService` to include the inventory client
   - Updated product creation flow to create inventory items automatically

### Integration Flow

When a product is created:

1. Product service creates the product record in its database
2. Product service calls the inventory service to create an inventory item
3. Inventory service creates the inventory record and returns the result
4. Product service continues with the rest of the product creation process

## API Gateway Integration

### Components Added

1. **Inventory Client** (`backend/api-gateway/clients/inventory_client.go`)
   - Handles communication with the inventory service
   - Provides methods for retrieving inventory information
   - Includes error handling and retry logic

2. **Inventory Handler** (`backend/api-gateway/handlers/inventory_handler.go`)
   - Handles HTTP requests related to inventory
   - Converts between HTTP and gRPC formats
   - Implements proper error handling and response formatting

3. **Route Updates**
   - Added inventory routes to the API gateway
   - Implemented proper authentication for admin-only endpoints

### API Endpoints

The following endpoints have been added to the API gateway:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Access |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `/api/v1/inventory/check` | GET | Check inventory availability | Public |
| `/api/v1/inventory/items` | GET | List inventory items | Admin |
| `/api/v1/inventory/items/:product_id` | GET | Get inventory for a product | Admin |
| `/api/v1/inventory/warehouses` | GET | List warehouses | Admin |

## Future Integrations

### Order Service Integration

The order service will integrate with the inventory service for:

1. **Inventory Reservation** - During checkout to temporarily hold inventory
2. **Inventory Confirmation** - When an order is placed to permanently reduce inventory
3. **Inventory Release** - When an order is canceled to return inventory

### Admin Dashboard Integration

The admin dashboard will integrate with the inventory service for:

1. **Inventory Management** - UI for viewing and updating inventory levels
2. **Warehouse Management** - UI for managing warehouses
3. **Inventory Reports** - UI for viewing inventory reports and analytics

## Testing

Integration tests will be added to verify:

1. Product service can successfully create inventory items
2. API gateway can successfully retrieve inventory information
3. Order service can successfully reserve and release inventory

## Deployment

The inventory service will be deployed as a separate microservice with:

1. Its own database for inventory data
2. Proper network configuration for service-to-service communication
3. Appropriate scaling based on load requirements
