# Inventory Service Technical Design

## 1. Introduction

The Inventory Service is a critical component of our e-commerce microservices architecture, responsible for managing product inventory across multiple warehouses, tracking inventory levels, handling reservations during checkout, and providing real-time inventory availability information.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Service Architecture

The Inventory Service follows our standard microservice architecture pattern:

```
Client Request → API Gateway → Inventory Service → Database
```

Internal service-to-service communication uses gRPC, while external communication via the API Gateway uses REST.

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Framework**: Standard Go libraries with gRPC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Message Broker**: (Future implementation for event-driven updates)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Configuration**: YAML and environment variables
- **Logging**: Zap logger

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Core Entities

#### Inventory Item
Represents the inventory for a product or variant:
- Tracks total, available, and reserved quantities
- Maintains inventory status (in stock, low stock, out of stock)
- Defines reorder points and quantities
- Links to product and variant IDs

#### Warehouse
Represents a physical location where inventory is stored:
- Contains location information
- Has priority for fulfillment
- Can be active or inactive

#### Inventory Location
Maps inventory items to warehouses:
- Tracks quantities at specific warehouses
- Maintains available and reserved quantities per location

#### Inventory Transaction
Records all changes to inventory:
- Captures the type of transaction (addition, removal, etc.)
- References external entities (orders, returns, etc.)
- Provides an audit trail for inventory changes

#### Inventory Reservation
Manages temporary holds on inventory:
- Created during checkout
- Has an expiration time
- Can be confirmed, cancelled, or fulfilled

### 3.2 Database Schema

See the implementation plan for detailed schema definitions.

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 gRPC Service Definition

The Inventory Service exposes the following gRPC endpoints:

#### Inventory Item Management
- `CreateInventoryItem`: Creates a new inventory item
- `GetInventoryItem`: Retrieves an inventory item by ID, product ID, or SKU
- `UpdateInventoryItem`: Updates an inventory item's properties
- `ListInventoryItems`: Lists inventory items with filtering and pagination

#### Warehouse Management
- `CreateWarehouse`: Creates a new warehouse
- `GetWarehouse`: Retrieves a warehouse by ID or code
- `UpdateWarehouse`: Updates a warehouse's properties
- `ListWarehouses`: Lists warehouses with filtering and pagination

#### Inventory Location Management
- `AddInventoryToLocation`: Adds inventory to a specific warehouse
- `RemoveInventoryFromLocation`: Removes inventory from a specific warehouse
- `GetInventoryByLocation`: Lists inventory at a specific warehouse

#### Reservation Management
- `ReserveInventory`: Creates temporary holds on inventory
- `ConfirmReservation`: Confirms a reservation (e.g., after payment)
- `CancelReservation`: Cancels a reservation (e.g., abandoned cart)

#### Inventory Checks
- `CheckInventoryAvailability`: Checks if requested quantities are available

#### Bulk Operations
- `BulkUpdateInventory`: Updates multiple inventory items in a single call

### 4.2 Error Handling

The service will return standard gRPC status codes:
- `OK (0)`: Success
- `INVALID_ARGUMENT (3)`: Invalid request parameters
- `NOT_FOUND (5)`: Resource not found
- `ALREADY_EXISTS (6)`: Resource already exists
- `FAILED_PRECONDITION (9)`: Business rule violation
- `INTERNAL (13)`: Internal server error

## 5. Business Logic

### 5.1 Inventory Management

#### Creating Inventory
- When a product is created, an inventory item is created
- Initial quantities can be allocated across warehouses
- Default status is set based on quantity

#### Updating Inventory
- Inventory can be added or removed
- Each change creates a transaction record
- Inventory status is automatically updated

#### Inventory Status
- `IN_STOCK`: Available quantity > reorder point
- `LOW_STOCK`: Available quantity <= reorder point and > 0
- `OUT_OF_STOCK`: Available quantity = 0
- `DISCONTINUED`: Product no longer stocked

### 5.2 Reservation System

#### Creating Reservations
- Reservations temporarily reduce available quantity
- Reservations have an expiration time
- System prevents over-reserving inventory

#### Confirming Reservations
- When an order is placed, reservations are confirmed
- Confirmed reservations reduce actual inventory
- Transaction records are created

#### Cancelling Reservations
- Cancelled reservations restore available quantity
- Transaction records are created

#### Expiring Reservations
- Background job cleans up expired reservations
- Expired reservations restore available quantity

### 5.3 Warehouse Management

#### Warehouse Priority
- Warehouses have a priority for fulfillment
- Higher priority warehouses are used first for reservations
- Inventory can be transferred between warehouses

## 6. Integration Points

### 6.1 Product Service Integration

- Product service calls inventory service when creating products
- Product service retrieves inventory information for product display
- Inventory updates can trigger product status updates

### 6.2 Order Service Integration

- Order service reserves inventory during checkout
- Order service confirms reservations on order placement
- Order service releases reservations on order cancellation

### 6.3 Admin Dashboard Integration

- Admin dashboard allows manual inventory management
- Admin dashboard displays inventory levels and history
- Admin dashboard can generate low stock reports

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Caching Strategy

- Cache frequently accessed inventory levels
- Cache warehouse information
- Implement cache invalidation on inventory updates

### 7.2 Database Optimization

- Use appropriate indexes for common queries
- Implement database connection pooling
- Consider read replicas for high-volume deployments

### 7.3 Concurrency Control

- Use database transactions for atomic operations
- Implement optimistic concurrency control
- Handle race conditions in reservation system

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Authentication and Authorization

- Implement service-to-service authentication
- Restrict inventory management to authorized users
- Log all inventory changes with user information

### 8.2 Data Validation

- Validate all input parameters
- Prevent negative inventory quantities
- Implement business rule validations

## 9. Monitoring and Observability

### 9.1 Logging

- Log all inventory transactions
- Log service errors and warnings
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing

### 9.2 Metrics

- Track inventory levels and status changes
- Monitor reservation creation and fulfillment rates
- Measure service response times

### 9.3 Alerts

- Alert on low stock conditions
- Alert on high reservation failure rates
- Alert on service errors

## 10. Future Enhancements

### 10.1 Event-Driven Architecture

- Implement event publishing for inventory changes
- Allow other services to subscribe to inventory events
- Reduce direct service-to-service coupling

### 10.2 Advanced Inventory Features

- Implement inventory forecasting
- Add support for bundles and kits
- Implement automatic reordering

### 10.3 Performance Improvements

- Implement database sharding for high-volume scenarios
- Add support for read replicas
- Optimize bulk operations
