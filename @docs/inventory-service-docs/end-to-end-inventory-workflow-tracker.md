# End-to-End Inventory Workflow Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the implementation progress of the end-to-end inventory workflow in our e-commerce system. It prioritizes implementation steps based on dependencies and business value.

## Implementation Priorities

The implementation is divided into phases, with each phase building on the previous one. The phases are prioritized based on:

1. **Core functionality** - Essential features needed for basic e-commerce operations
2. **Dependencies** - Features that other components depend on
3. **Business value** - Features that provide the most immediate value to users and administrators
4. **Complexity** - Starting with simpler components before tackling more complex ones
