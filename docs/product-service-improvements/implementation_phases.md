Implementation Phases
Phase 1 - Core Product Enhancements
Implement product variants and attributes. These should be handled in both the backend API and database, making sure product creation and update logic are updated accordingly.

Modify the product repository layer to support CRUD operations for variants.

Update cache management logic to handle variants and attributes efficiently.

Phase 2 - Reviews & Ratings
Implement a review system to allow customers to leave feedback.

Add rating aggregation logic to calculate and update the average rating per product.

Add helpful votes functionality to enable users to vote for reviews they found helpful.

Phase 3 - Additional Features
Implement a tagging system to categorize products.

Manage product specifications to allow detailed attributes to be attached to products.

Implement SEO fields for better product visibility.

Add shipping information for each product, including dimensions, weight, and delivery time.

Phase 4 - Price & Inventory
Enhance the price structure to support multi-currency, allowing the platform to cater to international markets.

Implement inventory tracking per variant, making it possible to track inventory at the variant level.

Support warehouse location management to track where products are physically stored.

Phase 5 - Search & Filter Enhancements
Add filtering by new attributes such as price range, product variant, rating, etc.

Implement advanced search functionality based on the new fields added.

Allow sorting by new fields, such as rating, price, and availability.

Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
Write unit tests for new models (e.g., product variant, review, specification).

Validate that CRUD operations on these models work as expected.

2. Integration Tests:
Test integration between the product service and new features like reviews, variants, and attributes.

Ensure all new API endpoints for managing variants, reviews, tags, etc., work as expected.

3. Performance Testing:
Perform performance testing to ensure that queries involving product variants, reviews, and filtering do not slow down the service.

4. Cache Invalidation Testing:
Make sure cache invalidation works properly for the new fields (e.g., updated ratings or prices).

Documentation
Update API Documentation: Add descriptions of the new endpoints such as creating reviews, fetching product variants, etc.

Document New Data Structures: Update the data structure documentation with the new models and fields.

Database Schema Documentation: Ensure that the updated schema for variants, reviews, tags, specifications, SEO, and shipping information is well-documented.
