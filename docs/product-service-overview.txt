Product Service Technical Overview
================================

Architecture & Technology Stack
-----------------------------
- Microservice architecture using gRPC
- Go (version 1.24)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching
- Docker containerization
- Air for hot-reload during development

Key Components
-------------
1. Proto Definitions (./proto/)
   - Well-structured product, brand, and category models
   - Comprehensive service definitions with CRUD operations
   - Uses protocol buffers with proper field types and nullability

2. Caching Layer (./cache/)
   - Redis-based caching implementation
   - Robust error handling and timeouts
   - Support for batch operations
   - Separate caching strategies for products, brands, and categories

3. Database
   - Clean schema design with proper relationships
   - UUID as primary keys
   - Proper indexing and constraints
   - Migration support

4. Service Layer
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Proper error handling
   - Context support for timeouts and cancellation
   - Business logic isolation

Development Tools
---------------
- Protobuf generation scripts (generate.bat)
- Docker support for containerization
- Air configuration for development
- Proper dependency management with go.mod

Best Practices Implemented
------------------------
1. Code Organization:
   - Clear folder structure following Go standards
   - Separation of concerns (handlers, models, repository, service)
   - Proper package naming

2. Error Handling:
   - Custom error types
   - Proper error wrapping
   - Context usage for timeouts

3. Configuration:
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Secrets management
   - Structured config files

4. Performance:
   - Caching implementation
   - Connection pooling
   - Batch operations support

Areas for Potential Enhancement
-----------------------------
1. Testing:
   - Add more unit tests
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add performance benchmarks

2. Monitoring:
   - Add metrics collection
   - Enhanced logging
   - Tracing implementation

3. Documentation:
   - API documentation
   - Setup instructions
   - Architecture diagrams

4. Resilience:
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Rate limiting
