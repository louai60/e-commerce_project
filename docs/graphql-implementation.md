# GraphQL Implementation for E-Commerce Project

## Overview

This document outlines the GraphQL implementation for our e-commerce project, focusing on how it enables efficient data fetching between services, particularly for inventory items that need product information.

## Architecture

The GraphQL implementation follows a layered approach:

1. **GraphQL Server**: Implemented in the API Gateway as a middleware
2. **GraphQL Schema**: Defined in `backend/api-gateway/schema/schema.graphql`
3. **GraphQL Resolvers**: Implemented in `backend/api-gateway/handlers/graphql_handler.go`
4. **GraphQL Client**: Implemented in the admin dashboard using Apollo Client

## Benefits

- **Reduced Over-fetching**: Only request the specific fields needed
- **Reduced Under-fetching**: Get related data in a single request
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing through GraphQL schema
- **Self-documenting API**: GraphQL introspection provides built-in documentation
- **Efficient Cross-Service Data Fetching**: Inventory service can get product names without direct coupling

## Implementation Details

### Backend (API Gateway)

The GraphQL server is implemented in the API Gateway using the following components:

- **GraphQL Schema**: Defines the types and queries available
- **GraphQL Handler**: Implements resolvers that fetch data from microservices
- **GraphQL Endpoint**: Available at `/api/v1/graphql`

The implementation uses the following libraries:
- `github.com/graphql-go/graphql`: Core GraphQL implementation
- `github.com/graphql-go/handler`: HTTP handler for GraphQL

### Frontend (Admin Dashboard)

The admin dashboard uses Apollo Client to interact with the GraphQL API:

- **Apollo Client**: Configured in `admin-dashboard/src/lib/apollo-client.ts`
- **Apollo Provider**: Wraps the application in `admin-dashboard/src/components/providers/ApolloProvider.tsx`
- **GraphQL Queries**: Defined in `admin-dashboard/src/graphql/queries/inventory.ts`
- **Custom Hooks**: Implemented in `admin-dashboard/src/hooks/useInventoryGraphQL.ts`

## Example Queries

### Fetch Inventory Items with Product Information

```graphql
query GetInventoryItems($page: Int!, $limit: Int!, $lowStockOnly: Boolean) {
  inventoryItems(page: $page, limit: $limit, lowStockOnly: $lowStockOnly) {
    items {
      id
      sku
      available_quantity
      total_quantity
      status
      product {
        id
        title
        images {
          url
        }
      }
    }
    pagination {
      current_page
      total_pages
      per_page
      total_items
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch Warehouses

```graphql
query GetWarehouses($page: Int!, $limit: Int!) {
  warehouses(page: $page, limit: $limit) {
    warehouses {
      id
      name
      code
      item_count
      total_quantity
    }
    pagination {
      current_page
      total_pages
      per_page
      total_items
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Apollo Client provides client-side caching
- **Batching**: Multiple queries can be batched into a single request
- **Pagination**: All list queries support pagination
- **Filtering**: Queries support filtering (e.g., `lowStockOnly`)

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: GraphQL endpoint uses the same authentication as REST endpoints
- **Authorization**: Access control is handled at the resolver level
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for GraphQL queries
- **Query Complexity Analysis**: Consider implementing query complexity analysis to prevent abuse

## Future Enhancements

- **Subscriptions**: Add real-time updates for inventory changes
- **Mutations**: Add support for creating and updating inventory items
- **Fragments**: Use fragments for reusable query parts
- **Persisted Queries**: Implement persisted queries for better performance
- **Automatic Persisted Queries**: Consider implementing APQ for better performance

## Conclusion

The GraphQL implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to fetch data across services, particularly for inventory items that need product information. It reduces the need for multiple API calls and allows clients to request only the data they need.
