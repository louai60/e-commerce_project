Product Service Database Technical Overview
=========================================

Core Tables & Relationships
-------------------------
1. products
   Primary Key: id (UUID)
   Key Fields:
   - title, slug (unique)
   - description, short_description
   - price, discount_price
   - sku (unique)
   - inventory_qty, weight
   - is_published
   - brand_id (FK -> brands.id)
   - created_at, updated_at
   Indexes: slug, sku, brand_id

2. brands
   Primary Key: id (UUID)
   Key Fields:
   - name
   - slug (unique)
   - description
   - created_at, updated_at
   Indexes: slug

3. categories
   Primary Key: id (UUID)
   Key Fields:
   - name
   - slug (unique)
   - description
   - parent_id (self-referential FK)
   - parent_name
   - created_at, updated_at
   Indexes: slug, parent_id

4. product_images
   Primary Key: id (UUID)
   Key Fields:
   - product_id (FK -> products.id)
   - url
   - alt_text
   - position
   - created_at, updated_at
   Indexes: product_id

5. product_categories (Junction Table)
   Primary Key: (product_id, category_id)
   Fields:
   - product_id (FK -> products.id)
   - category_id (FK -> categories.id)
   Indexes: product_id, category_id

Relationships
------------
1. Product -> Brand (Many-to-One)
   - products.brand_id -> brands.id
   - Optional relationship (nullable brand_id)

2. Product <-> Categories (Many-to-Many)
   - Through product_categories junction table
   - ON DELETE CASCADE for both directions

3. Product -> Images (One-to-Many)
   - product_images.product_id -> products.id
   - ON DELETE CASCADE

4. Category -> Category (Self-referential)
   - categories.parent_id -> categories.id
   - Optional relationship (nullable parent_id)
   - ON DELETE SET NULL for parent relationship

Technical Review & Critique
-------------------------
Strengths:
✓ Well-normalized structure
✓ Proper use of UUIDs for primary keys
✓ Appropriate indexing on frequently queried fields
✓ Consistent timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
✓ Good use of constraints and cascading deletes
✓ Proper handling of optional relationships

Critical Points & Recommendations:

1. Timestamp Handling
   ISSUE: Inconsistent timezone handling
   - Some timestamps use TIMESTAMP, others TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
   RECOMMENDATION: 
   - Standardize on TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE throughout
   - Add explicit timezone handling in application code

2. Soft Delete
   ISSUE: Inconsistent soft delete implementation
   - Some queries check for deleted_at IS NULL, but column not visible in schema
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add deleted_at to all major entities
   - Implement consistent soft delete pattern
   - Add indexes on deleted_at where frequently filtered

3. Audit Trail
   ISSUE: Basic audit capabilities only
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add modified_by_user_id to track changes
   - Consider audit log table for important entities
   - Add version/revision tracking for products

4. Performance Concerns
   ISSUE: Potential scalability bottlenecks
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add partial indexes for is_published=true
   - Consider partitioning for products table
   - Add composite indexes for common query patterns

5. Data Integrity
   ISSUE: Missing constraints
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add CHECK constraints for price > 0
   - Add CHECK constraints for inventory_qty >= 0
   - Validate discount_price < price
   - Add constraints for valid image URLs

6. Category Hierarchy
   ISSUE: Limited hierarchy support
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Consider implementing closure table pattern
   - Add materialized path for better tree traversal
   - Cache category tree structure

7. Product Variants
   ISSUE: No support for product variants
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add product_variants table
   - Add variant_attributes table
   - Implement SKU generation system

8. Search Optimization
   ISSUE: Limited search capabilities
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add full-text search indexes
   - Consider implementing tsvector columns
   - Add trigram indexes for fuzzy matching

9. Internationalization
   ISSUE: No multi-language support
   RECOMMENDATION:
   - Add translations tables
   - Implement language-specific fields
   - Add currency handling

10. Data Validation
    ISSUE: Relies heavily on application-level validation
    RECOMMENDATION:
    - Add more database-level constraints
    - Implement triggers for complex validations
    - Add check constraints for business rules

Future Considerations
-------------------
1. Implement product attribute system for flexible properties
2. Add inventory tracking and stock movement history
3. Consider implementing event sourcing for product changes
4. Add support for product bundles and collections
5. Implement price history tracking
6. Add support for dynamic pricing rules
7. Consider sharding strategy for large-scale deployment
